\section*{Description}
Books can be borrowed from a small library. Each book has a title and an ISBN. The library can store one book multiple times. 
As the library is small, it can only store 10 books.

\section*{Tasks}
\begin{enumerate}
     \item Write the classes \textit{Library} and \textit{Book}.
     \item Write a constructor for the class \textit{Book}, which takes title and ISBN as arguments.
     \item Implement a \textit{main Method} in the class \textit{Library}, which tests the \textit{Book}'s methods.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Hints}
\begin{itemize}
    \item An ISBN consists of 13 characters. Use \texttt{long} or \texttt{String} instead of \texttt{int}.
    \item When assigning the number as \texttt{long}, an \texttt{L} is attached: \texttt{long var = 1234501234567890L}.
\end{itemize}
